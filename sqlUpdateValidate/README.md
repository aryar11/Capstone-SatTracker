# SQL Update Scripts

This folder holds the code that is run on the AWS Virtual Machine. The code runs once a day to update our SQL tables with the newest TLEs from space-track.org.

Additionally, it holds the validation script that validates that the information in the SQL table is the same as what we downloaded from the website.
